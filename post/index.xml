&lt;p&gt;I am a chemist whose research experience is related to physical &amp;amp; theoretical chemistry and materials, particularly atomic clusters, excited states,  and currently 2D&amp;amp;biological materials. I graduated (Ph.D.) from  Department of Chemistry, University of Leuven, Belgium (September 2019), and is currently working as a postdoctoral research fellow at Deakin  University and visiting scholar at Department of Physics, RMIT,  Australia. I was also a yearly-contract lecturer at Department of  Chemistry, University of Dalat, Vietnam.&lt;/p&gt;
